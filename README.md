#### Instruction

- Tweets collector is credential information with Strayn's intern company therefore we cannot put it on github repo.  
- Spam filter code is in the filter_tweets function in ./lib/utils/tweets_topic.py   
- Disambiguator logic is in ./lib/irrelevant_filter.py  
- fastText embedding training and t-SNE visualization is in ./lib/word_embedding.py  
- Deep Averaging Network training and testing is in ./lib/dan_qa/train.py   
- Related POS analysis is in ./lib/topic_model.py (We didn't include this in final report)  


Since we drop code relating to Tweets Collector and change the structure of the files, the program might not work properly, the idea is in the final report.
